# Math 253 Assignments

This repository will contain *all* your work to be handed in for Math 253. You will hand in the work by "pushing" it to the GitHub repository that has been set up for you.

Make sure you are pushing to the right repository.

## Instructions

All components of your work will be done in `.Rmd` files. Each assignment or in-class programming activity has a corresponding `.Rmd` file that you are to put your work in. Make sure to use exactly that file, but you are free to add supplementary files (e.g. for data, or your own notes, etc.)

1. When you start work on an item, open that `.Rmd` file.
2. Edit the file, typically going through a cycle of edit, compile, debug, ...
3. When you are ready to submit your work:
    1. Go to the GIT tab in RStudio, and check the box by the file to "stage" it. 
        * Also check the box by the correspondsing HTML file, if there is one.
    2. Press "COMMIT" and make an appropriate message for the commit, e.g. "Handing in Daily Programming 7"
    3. PULL from the repository. Most of the time you will see an "Everything up to date" message.
    4. PUSH to the repository.

If you decide to revise your work, go ahead, starting with step (2). You do not and should not create a new file, just modify your old one. 

Whenever you COMMIT your work, it is saved on your own system.

When you PUSH your work, it is saved to GitHub and the professor has access to it.

## Assignment Files

For simplicity, all of the files are being stored in the root directory of this repository. 

* `Topic-2.Rmd`, `Topic-3.Rmd`, etc. which will hold your answers to the book exercises.
* `01-Programming.Rmd`, `02-Programming.Rmd`, etc. which will hold your daily programming work.
* `Project.Rmd` will hold an abstract of your end-of-term project and a link to the GitHub repository that you and your team create to hold your work.
